1.The console prints 3 because i is incremented by 3 due to the length of the array which is 3.
2.It prints 150 because it is printing the function itself.
3.It prints 150. This is because the var is declared outside the forloop function
4.Nothing would appear in the console but discounted would return as [50,100,150]
 5. ReferenceError: i is not defined because it is limited to the block.
6.Error, discountedPrice is declared let inside the loop
7.150 This is because finalPrice is let at line 4 that is the same block as line 1.
8.[50, 100, 150] , let allocates the discounted array varibale.
9.Error i is declared in 
10. 3 . const is declared inside length. Elements can be changed inside the loop.
11. [50, 100, 150]
12. 
A: student.name
B: student['Grad Year']
C: student.greeting()
D: student['Favorite Teacher']['name']
E: student.courseLoad[0]
13.
A. '32 because '3' is a string so + 'adds
B. 1,  3 is converted to a number 
C. 3, because null is 0 when is a number 
D. '3null',  null is  a string then merged as '3' is a string 
E. 4 because of the numeric conversion rules 
F. 0, because false act as 0 and null act as 0 too when they are numbers and added to be 0 
G. 3undefined, because '3' is a string so undefined is converted to a string
H. NaN, numeric conversion rule says undefined is NanN1
14.
A: true  the values are converted to numbers.
B: false considering lexicographical order  2 is greather than 12
C: true 2 is converted to number
D: false Because === represnets strict equality operator therefore different type will be false
E: false For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.
F: true With boolean conversion rules, only 0 is false. Thus, Boolean(2) will convert to true
15.
=== operator is called strict equality operator which checks value and type equality and == checks for value equality
16. Answer in directory.
17. return [2, 4, 6].  This is because we conduct doSomething on each element of the first element. 1 becomes 2 pushing 2 to the newArr. Continuing this process 2 now becomes 4 and we  pushe 4. 3 becomes 6 and we push 6. 
19. Answer in the directory.
19. The output is 1 4 3 2
