1.The console prints 3 because i is incremented by 3 due to the length of the array which is 3.<br/> 
2.It prints 150 because it is printing the function itself.<br/>
3.It prints 150. This is because the var is declared outside the forloop function <br/>
4.Nothing would appear in the console but discounted would return as [50,100,150]<br/>
 5. ReferenceError: i is not defined because it is limited to the block. <br/>
6.Error, discountedPrice is declared let inside the loop <br/>
7.150 This is because finalPrice is let at line 4 that is the same block as line 1. <br/>
8.[50, 100, 150] , let allocates the discounted array varibale. <br/>
9.Error i is declared in the block and we are trying to access it outside <br/>
10. 3 . const is declared inside length. Elements can be changed inside the loop. <br/>
11. [50, 100, 150]<br/>
12. 
A: student.name <br/>
B: student['Grad Year'] <br/>
C: student.greeting() <br/>
D: student['Favorite Teacher']['name'] <br/>
E: student.courseLoad[0]<br/>
13.
A. '32 because '3' is a string so + 'adds <br/>
B. 1,  3 is converted to a number <br/>
C. 3, because null is 0 when is a number <br/>
D. '3null',  null is  a string then merged as '3' is a string <br/>
E. 4 because of the numeric conversion rules <br/>
F. 0, because false act as 0 and null act as 0 too when they are numbers and added to be 0 <br/>
G. 3undefined, because '3' is a string so undefined is converted to a string<br/>
H. NaN, numeric conversion rule says undefined is NanN1<br/>
14.
A: true  the values are converted to numbers.<br/>
B: false considering lexicographical order  2 is greather than 12<br/>
C: true 2 is converted to number<br/>
D: false Because === represnets strict equality operator therefore different type will be false<br/>
E: false For boolean values, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0.<br/>
F: true With boolean conversion rules, only 0 is false. Thus, Boolean(2) will convert to true<br/>
15.
=== operator is called strict equality operator which checks value and type equality and == checks for value equality<br/>
16. Answer in directory.<br/>
17. return [2, 4, 6].  This is because we conduct doSomething on each element of the first element. 1 becomes 2 pushing 2 to the newArr. Continuing this process 2 now becomes 4 and we  pushe 4. 3 becomes 6 and we push 6. <br/>
19. Answer in the directory.<br/>
19. The output is 1 4 3 2 <br/>
